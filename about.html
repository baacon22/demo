        <h1>History of ICLHO</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="history-p1">The Birth of ICLHO: A Historical Approach Discussing the Creation of Iloilo City Local Housing Office (ICLHO)</p>
        <p>
        The Iloilo City Local Housing Office (ICLHO) stands as a cornerstone in providing essential housing services to the Ilonggos, 
        particularly tied to the development of public housing policies and urban planning efforts that aimed at addressing shelter 
        needs within the City of Iloilo.
        </p>
        <p>
        Prior to the establishment of ICLHO, Mayor Jerry P. Treñas extinguished the Iloilo City Urban Poor Affairs (ICUPAO) and established a new
        department specifically dedicated to local housing sites, relocation, and resettlement, thus giving rise to the Office of Iloilo City 
        Local Housing.   
        </p>
        <p>
        Mayor Treñas advocated for the creation of ICLHO to revamp the services of the Iloilo City Urban Poor Affairs (ICUPAO) in a bid to improve
        and upscale its services, especially in the implementation of housing programs and projects. Under Regulation Ordinance No. 2023-193: An 
        Ordinance Creating The Iloilo City Local Housing Office (ICLHO), enumerating its functions and appropriating funds that was enacted on 
        August 23, 2023, with the supervision of the newly appointed department head, Atty. Peter Jason Millare, the ICLHO is tasked with 
        streamlining the application process for eligible beneficiaries, as defined by the Iloilo City Local Housing Board (ICLHB), by managing 
        applications, conducting social profiling through the data collection of Informal Settler Families (ISFs) and other qualified beneficiaries,
        assessing relocation sites and high-risk areas, and presenting findings to the ICLHB for evaluation and appropriate action. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Moving forward, ICLHO has evolved and rebranded itself as the regulatory body for local housing affairs. Noteworthy progress has been achieved,
        fostering a more transparent and just environment for beneficiaries. Since December 2023, ICLHO has been entrusted with implementing policies
        set forth by the Iloilo City Local Housing Board (ICLHB), overseeing the application process for qualified beneficiaries, monitoring post-award
        activities to ensure compliance with city policies, and managing all housing programs and initiatives on behalf of the Iloilo City Government.
        </p>
        <p>
        Over time, ICLHO has assumed a pivotal role in managing all public housing projects, which consist of Thirty-Five (35) local housing sites and 
        Two (2) low-rise condominiums owned or acquired by the Iloilo City Government. They conduct thorough evaluations of completed and ongoing shelter
        projects in informal settler areas and relocation sites, collaborate with beneficiaries, and recommend appropriate actions to the Iloilo City 
        Local Housing Board and the City Mayor. Additionally, ICLHO coordinates with national and local government agencies on public housing programs,
        formulates development projects and policies, maintains a comprehensive database of Informal Settler Families and beneficiaries, proposes 
        designs and amenities for public housing projects, submits regular performance reports to the City Council and the Iloilo City Local Housing
        Board, and ensures participatory governance and effective housing policies for a safer and more inclusive community. For only a few months, 
        the occupancy validation peaks at 57.14% (20 sites over 35 total relocation sites).
        </p>
        <p>
        As the ICLHO strives towards its objectives, it anticipates encountering obstacles along its journey. Despite challenges, the vision remains steadfast
        in creating a thriving community that prioritizes safety, inclusivity, resilience, and sustainable development, fostering empowered and vibrant living
        environments for Ilonggos.
